I am a Master student at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.mathematik-informatik-statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) majoring in Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence. My research interests include machine learning, especially adversarial machine learning, and their application to data analysis, computer vision and robotics. In particular, I am interested in improving the robustness and explanability of current deep learning algorithms and apply them to solve real-world tasks.

I am currently writing my master thesis at [X-Order Lab](http://xorder.ai).
